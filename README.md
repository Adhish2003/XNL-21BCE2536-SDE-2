1. Frontend (ReactJS):
ReactJS is used to build a dynamic, responsive frontend, providing users with an interactive experience.
Material UI is utilized for a clean and professional design, ensuring that the app looks visually appealing and user-friendly.
React Routing helps in navigating between different pages like the homepage, stock dashboard, and user profile.
React Hooks are used for managing state and side-effects in a functional component style. This ensures efficient re-rendering of the UI whenever the state changes, improving the performance and user interaction.
2. Backend (Node.js and ExpressJS):
Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It ensures that the backend of the app is scalable and can handle concurrent requests efficiently.
ExpressJS is a minimal web framework that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It is used to handle routes for user authentication, retrieving stock information, and managing user transactions (buy/sell stocks).
Key API Routes:
Authentication:
Users are able to log in and register using secure authentication mechanisms (like JWT or sessions).
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) can be used for maintaining sessions and securely transmitting user authentication details.
Stock Information:
The backend interacts with external APIs (like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.) to fetch real-time stock data, including current prices, historical charts, and trends.
Stock data is parsed and sent to the frontend where it can be displayed in charts and tables.
User Transactions:
Users can simulate buying and selling stocks. The backend ensures that the transactions are processed correctly within the user’s $100k budget.
Each transaction is stored in the database for tracking user portfolios and stock holdings.
3. Database (MongoDB):
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores user and stock-related data. Its flexible schema allows for easy scaling and fast retrieval of data.
The user data (username, password, budget, transaction history, portfolio) is stored in a collection.
The stock data (including stock symbol, price, and user transactions) is also stored in MongoDB, allowing easy updates and queries as users interact with the app.
4. Features of the App:
User Authentication: Secure login/signup using JWT tokens or session-based authentication.
Stock Market Simulation:
Users have a simulated balance of $100k, which they can use to buy and sell stocks in real-time.
Stock prices update dynamically, providing a realistic simulation of the stock market.
Real-time Stock Data and Charts:
Interactive charts and stock data are fetched and displayed for users to make informed decisions about which stocks to invest in.
Data is visualized using popular charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) integrated with ReactJS.
Portfolio Management:
Users can view their portfolio to see how their investments are performing. This includes tracking stock prices, purchase prices, and the overall portfolio value.
The app provides a dashboard with charts and tables for easy understanding of their investments.
Transaction History:
Users can review their transaction history, including the stocks they’ve bought or sold, the price at which they were bought/sold, and their remaining budget.
